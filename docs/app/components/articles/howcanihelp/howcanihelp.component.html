                <br>Less than a year ago, Facebook feeds and Twitter timelines were filled with a single hashtag: #MeToo.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>The hashtag was often accompanied by personal tales and traumatic experiences of sexual harassment, assault, and/or rape. 
                Either that, or it was sometimes left alone; leaving out the details while putting a face to the magnitude of the problem. 
                It’s one thing to see a statistic; it’s another to see a friend or an acquaintance speak up. Nevertheless, 
                solidarity behind an all too common experience grew and grew into a behemoth too large to silence.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>People voiced their support and asked the age-old ally question: <i>How can I help?</i><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Being an ally for such a sensitive issue might seem difficult. You want to help, but you don’t want to pry or push. 
                However, it shouldn’t be necessary to know someone’s entire story to help them. Too often, the onus of discussing sexual 
                assault falls on victims/survivors to share their own stories of trauma. But no one owes you their story. People shouldn’t 
                need to disclose their experiences in order for you to care about them. If you really want to be an ally, and if you really
                want to help, then make it a priority to do so without exception. You shouldn’t need a face on the issue to care about it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>And how do you help? You begin by listening.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Listen to what your friends are saying, what the community is saying, and, most importantly, what you are saying.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Start with your own actions first. The rhetoric you use and the way you approach these types of situations both have heavy 
                effects that leave those who have survived sexual violence wondering about their own experiences at times. Do you make comments 
                that make others uncomfortable? Do you ever touch people in ways they don’t want? Notice how your words and your actions 
                affect others. The discussion around what is and isn’t acceptable in the world of dating have left some, mainly men, scared 
                about their own actions. However, if you’re worried that your actions might be misconstrued as sexual harassment, then 
                maybe you need to re-evaluate what you consider as acceptable ways of flirting and joking.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Next, look at the people who you choose to surround yourself with. Be vocal about what you care about. Make sure everyone 
                knows where you stand. Become that cousin at Thanksgiving dinner. Call people out, but don’t try to start a fight, or even try 
                to be condescending towards them. If someone is making insensitive or inappropriate comments at this Thanksgiving dinner, make 
                it a priority to call them in to question. Ask questions like "Why do you think that's funny?" and perhaps response with 
                “Oh, I don’t really get it.” Explain why you do not find that comment funny and why it makes you feel uncomfortable if you can. 
                You can even talk to them after dinner is over, if you do not want to do it around the entire family. Chisel away at their 
                so-called sense of humor, until they finally begin to re-evaluate what they have said. It’s more important to create teaching 
                moments such as this than it is to correct someone and feel vindicated in a moral high ground. Don’t assume malice when 
                unfamiliarity is an option. This isn’t to say that we need to spoon-feed emotional labor to those who choose make insensitive or 
                inappropriate comments, but it can be an option. Teach people constructive lessons, call people into the conversation, 
                and help people along the way.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Now look at your community. How are servers treated at restaurants and cafes? Is the conversation next to you 
                inappropriate? Should you say something? Intervention isn’t always necessary, but it’s important to be prepared. 
                Sometimes it’s enough to let someone know that you’re there. Learn about local organizations and resources available 
                to you and share them.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>As a bottom line, you need to ensure that people are seen and heard. Make it known that you can be trusted, 
                that someone could come to you if they needed to. If someone does choose to tell you about a prior sexual assault, 
                don’t do anything without their permission. Don’t report it, don’t confront the perpetrator, don’t tell anyone else. 
                Listen to what people have to say and what they want. Sometimes, they will want to take action. Sometimes, all they 
                want is support and validation. And sometimes they won’t know what they want at all. Be the person who can help them 
                through any of it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Just before #MeToo began, I distinctly remember a group conversation about sexual assault. A male friend commented 
                that he didn’t think he knew anyone who had ever been assaulted. A female friend replied that he did. Sexual violence 
                is more real than one could imagine. According to the <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf">
                National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 
                16 men will be sexually assaulted on a college campus. On top of this glaring statistic, 90% of those who have experienced 
                sexual assault on college campuses do not report their assault to higher authorities.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>More likely than not, you know someone who has been sexually assaulted. You know someone who has been raped. 
                They have no duty to disclose their experiences to you. However, they are there when you make a rape joke. They are 
                listening when you laugh at someone else’s rape joke. They are noticing when you don’t speak up against rape jokes. 
                Most of all, they notice your complacency towards rape jokes.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>The hashtag has become a movement and #MeToo has transformed into #TimesUp. People are demanding they be listened 
                to and we are going to make sure they are heard.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>If you can, another easy way to help is to put your money where your mouth is. Organizations like 
                <a href="https://www.rainn.org/about-rainn">RAINN</a> and the <a href="https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/">Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund</a>
                are helping real people fight against sexual assault every day. Donating money helps support 
                the important work that they do in continuing to deconstruct rape culture. Even though not everyone has the financial means 
                to do so, every  share on a social media platform helps and every discussion pushes us forward.<br>
