                <br>
                Their skin was not sandal like mine was,<br>
                Their foreheads were not dotted with vermillion.<br>
                Their eyes were not as round and curious as mine were,<br>
                Their brows did not raise questions.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="poem">
                <br>
                They treated me as if I was an exotic flower of paradise<br>
                But little did they understand that I was like them,<br>
                But I just came in a different hue,<br>
                So when autumn came and my duller colors showed,<br>
                They did not know how to react.<br>

            </p>

            <p class="poem">
                <br>
                I still yearn for the soft zephyrs of my motherland,<br>
                The silken dew painted on the morning grass,<br>
                And for the whispers of safety and comfort<br>
                When I run into the open arms of the orange horizon.<br>

            </p>

            <p class="poem">
                <br>
                Despite all the odds,<br>
                I somehow made a home in this odd place.<br>
                I will write chapters on creamy paper with my tan hands<br>
                And set warm fire with my words to shelter those who need it<br>
                Because some feel that they still do not belong in this alienated place.<br>

            </p>

            <p class="poem">
                <br>
                Despite all the odds, <br>
                I am proud of my roots and I will not atrophy<br>
                Or be uprooted by those who think I am a weed.<br>
                My soul is tied to the earth<br>
                And I cannot change my history,<br>
                I cannot change who I truly am.<br>
            </p>
