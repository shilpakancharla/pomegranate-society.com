            <p>
                <br>Vijay Sridharan introduces himself as “a writer, director, and actor” who has been in 
                the Bay Area for two years, and is originally from India. He is an actor and the director 
                of <i>Peacock: Indian Gangster Mockumentary</i> about an Indian gangster that lives in the Bay 
                Area.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I had the chance to watch a screening at a Bay Area Filmmaker mixer. I’m so curious 
                how Asian males are portrayed in the media, especially the idea of masculinity and all 
                its challenges and hardships.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I tell Vijay “I love and appreciate how your comedic storytelling isn’t necessarily 
                a drive to be social satire but just the way you see the world. Would you free to talk about any of that? 
                Masculinity? Why gangster?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Vijay says “...after the film turned out, it is a comment on immigration, the American Dream, 
                inclusion, and diversity in America.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Vijay says he “just cast the film based on what the story requested. It ended up having a pretty diverse cast. 
                That [mockumentary] can happen only in America that’s an Indian guy running a gang because there are no Indian 
                gangs in America.” In the mockumentary, Scott, or Peacock Gupta’s sidekick, is a middle-aged white guy who has a 
                midlife crisis so he’s joined a gang. Vijay says that he’s “glad to portray the role of an Asian male 
                in an American society.” He believes his work is a comment on inclusion and diversity of the American dream.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>My next question to Vijay asks why he thinks there are no Indian gangsters in America, and why that might be unexpected.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Indians have a huge role in modern American society. The tech industry has a lot of Indians. The CEOs of Google 
                and Microsoft are Indian. However, Indians are not necessarily represented in the streets. Vijay says, his character 
                Peacock, wants to be cool, and so he decides to be a gangster. “He thinks it’s an answer to the fact that India is 
                underrepresented in the gang world [in America].” Vijay thinks it’s something he can improve on.<br>
            </p>

            <p><br><img src="../../../../assets/images/peacockaddphoto.png"><br></p>

            <p>
                <br>I’m sweating and laughing right now. So it’s an interpretation of, the character of Peacock, that [gang life is] coolness. 
                Not really the violence or trafficking aspect, but a mere question of “Why can’t I participate and represent there?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“You mentioned Indian gangsters, in reality right now, aren’t represented and that’s a good thing. For the character you created 
                in Peacock, what doesn’t he understand about gang life?” I ask Vijay.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Vijay answers Peacock Gupta “doesn’t understand that gang life is not actually cool. One is better off not being in a 
                gang and in a regular job.” It’s a coolness. Even though he’s not a criminal, in the story we see him boasting about 
                the activities he does. He says he dabbles in contraband, and he can get stuff cheaper than anywhere else. The camera 
                catches him going to Trader Joe’s, and that’s where he gets his stuff. He’s basically fronting. Deep down, he’s not as 
                tough as he thinks he is. It’s all about the appearance.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Next, I ask Vijay “As a writer how did you write his character to include the ensemble of his enablers on his quest? 
                How did you create the characters of all his enablers like the middle-aged white male experiencing a midlife crisis?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Vijay says “I was just going with the reality of it. What he does is rooted in reality. In reality it’s pretty pathetic 
                that he’s chosen this way of life, basically husting groceries but convincing people that he’s dealing drugs or whatever.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>As for Peacock Gupta’s partner in crime, Vijay thought it should be a middle-aged white guy who think it’s cool to be in 
                a gang. His reasoning is that it’s based in Fremont, which has a large Indian population. The white guy’s reasoning is 
                Indians are the biggest community in Fremont so he wants to get their good side before it’s too late, and that he wants 
                to be included in something. The motivations are sketchy but it’s still very entertaining to watch.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“How did you get the diverse cast that includes diversity in age too?” I ask Vijay. Vijay says the beauty of that 
                aspect lies in the Bay Area, which is very diverse. “We shot in Fremont and Dublin. Most of the actors we shot were 
                non-actors. We would ask ‘Would you say something on the camera?’ We didn’t feed them any lines. They are just saying 
                stuff pertaining to where they are from.” Vijay uses the authentic responses from people in his mockumentary.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“The first words out of our mouth: ‘we’re doing a comedy.’ They were like: ‘cool.’ How do you be part of this? Where 
                is this going?” Next, Vijay adds “They were really forthcoming to be themselves. We had no negative responses such as you 
                cannot film here or anything like that.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Next, I tell Vijay “In the stories I’ve covered in the past, there’s this idea of the incredible pressure of the model 
                minority for Asians. Could you talk about that?<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“The whole work ethic thing. The education ideal. That can be thought of as pressure sometimes. But I was reflecting 
                on this the other day. The whole Asian diaspora. They are doing so many things right in America, especially from the 
                education and work standpoint. That needs to be commended.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>The term “Indian gangster” is an oxymoron in that sense. “Even though there’s a supposed pressure ultimately it’s a 
                great thing the Asian population has such a high standard for education.” Vijay also tells me that “The only reason 
                Peacock has become a gangster is that he never went to college.” While the oxymoron is present, we must recognize that 
                Peacock Gupta is someone who perhaps couldn’t handle the pressure.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Perhaps another important to acknowledge is that there are actually Indian students growing up in schools that ape 
                gangsters’ looks from movies. “Purely from research, I didn’t know students behaved like that,” says Vijay. 
                Vijay also says that his influences were Key and Peele, and upon watching Jordan Peele’s <i>Get Out</i>, inspired and 
                influenced him to explore the social satire genre.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>In my last question to Vijay, I ask “What insights do you have Asian Americans, or any individuals, who may think 
                there aren’t roles for me currently being created?” I ponder if Vijay created Peacock Gupta because he wanted to create 
                a role that didn’t exist.<br>
            </p>

            <p><br><img src="../../../../assets/images/peacockscene.jpeg"><br></p>

            <p>
                <br>“You are right that there are not many leading roles for ethnic minorities. The roles that exist are pretty 
                stereotypical. I ended up playing it because I couldn’t find too many people to play it. It has evolved into a unique 
                role for an ethnic minority. I say the best way to do it is organically. Tell your own story. Tell your own immigrant 
                experience. Tell your own perspective of the American Dream.”<br>
            </p>


        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>
                <br>Vijay adds “The authenticity comes from what you know. And then if you want to play this, it’s a natural organic
                progression. The more we are honest and tell the stories we know and we want to put it out there, there are going to be 
                more roles coming from South Asian and the whole ethnic minority scene in America.”<br>
            </p>
            
            <p><br><img src="../../../../assets/images/peacockposter.jpg"><br></p>

            <p>
                <br>In addition to speaking to Vijay Sridharan, I also had the opportunity to speak to Jhari Townsend, an actor in 
                <i>Peacock</i>. Jhari introduces himself as being originally from the Bay Area, and has a background in modeling, acting, 
                and fashion. I ask Jhari if he used any of his modeling and fashion ideas to assist with Peacock. 
                “Did you have any input about hair or skin care? Or costume?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“Actually, I did incorporate aspects into the character. I kind of channeled the character beyond myself. 
                I styled a look based off the character he gave me.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Next, I ask Jhari “How did you decide to say yes to this project with Vijay?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari says “It seemed interesting. I didn’t know what ‘Indian gangster’ meant at the time. 
                It sparked curiosity. We met up and I read the lines. I was not lead role. I was casted for the background gangster. 
                When I got to the actual shoot, the guy that was casted for the lead role said he didn’t feel comfortable playing 
                the main gangster. So me? I have a little street background or whatever. So I felt I could channel the character 
                really well. So I went ahead and accepted the role. When I accepted, that’s when I brainstormed the looks and 
                concept trying to channel the character beyond myself.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I then ask Jhari “When you decided to take the role of primary gangster, you mention you drew a little bit about a 
                street background?” Jhari says that used his experience and put together elements from media and TV as well. “I looked 
                through magazines. I noted all those things together for different looks” says Jhari.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Curiously, I ask Jhari “Because of your artistic and business background in modeling and fashion knowing that Fremont, 
                California does not have the reputation of having an actual gang how did you make the artistic and business decision not 
                to accidentally make reference to a real existing gang?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“I looked at it from a general standpoint. I didn’t like to characterize it or put it in a box. It was just the typical 
                gangster. It was not a gangster from a certain area or specific look from a certain gang.” Jhari uses his artistic and 
                business side to choose a general look in order to avoid offending anyone.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>We also discussed concerns about a South Asian male actor/writer talking about the American experience, even in a 
                comedic sense, that includes people of African descent and Latinx background being portrayed as gangsters. The Pomegranate 
                Society wanted to remain sensitive about the conversation, and asked Jhari if there was any comment he would like 
                to make regarding this.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>“I don’t feel there is anything wrong. We are all a culture put together as one. I feel like it’s okay to discuss 
                anyone, as long as you are not making anyone look bad. It’s fine to highlight some things based off of issues. It should 
                not be based off of color or culture. If it’s an issue it’s an issue. If the issue needs to be rectified, then it needs 
                to be rectified. I don’t see anything wrong with that” says Jhari.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari also adds that the typical Fremont person of traditional Indian descent would tend to be conservative, 
                family-oriented, and law-abiding. “It’s the opposite to show there are some other people out there. Not to say they are 
                bad. It’s the other side of things, just to show that everything does not have to be all safe. Be edgy.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I also ask Jhari if he had any input on what Vijay wore when he played Peacock Gupta. Jhari says “He transformed 
                into a whole different person. If you see him regularly, he has long hair, more professional casual, most of the time. 
                But in the movie, he had a hardcore gangster look. It was cool to see a different side and a different look.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I ask about the little dog that accompanies the gangster that Jhari plays too, and what significance that could 
                have to Jhari’s character in the film. I ask Jhari “Does the little dog have meaning in character development? Does 
                it reveal anything about the character you play, like that he’s not that hardcore?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari says “He is a person. He has a real cute dog.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari also talks about his fashion choices: “I try out different looks too. Sometimes, I like to dress with a lot of 
                distressed clothing and street clothing like that. Other times I do a preppy, sophisticated style. Fashion gives me an 
                outlet to show my personality, to express myself. It gives me a feeling of freedom, instead of feeling I’m closed in a box 
                and I have to dress a certain way. I dress how I feel.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari also adds “It’s a good thing to adapt certain things from different cultures. For instance, I love Asian culture, 
                like Japanese culture. I like to play off that in the way I dress. Extended long shirts and how they do the preppy looks. 
                I love it a lot. I go to the overseas websites to get exclusive items that people don't wear out here. I want to go and 
                absorb the influences, the culture, the everything...when you adapt, it makes you a well rounded person.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Jhari leaves me with a profound thought: “Everybody out here, it’s one culture. We all have different traditions. 
                If you put that all together all the different races and cultures we can grow. We should all come together. 
                Embrace each other's’ culture. With acceptance, we can go so much further.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>On behalf of The Pomegranate Society, I would like to thank Jhari Townsend and Vijay Sridharan for meeting with me 
                to do these interviews, and educating the audience about their mockumentary. It was an honor and joy to meet with them. <br>
