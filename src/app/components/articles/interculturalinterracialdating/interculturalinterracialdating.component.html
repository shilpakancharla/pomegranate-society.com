                <br>Interracial and cross-cultural dating can be a difficult frontier for first-and-second 
                generation immigrants to overcome. A new, unfamiliar country is filled with already burgeoning 
                questions concerning everyday parenting — private or public school? How does the SAT work? 
                Will we continue to speak in our native tongue at home? Cross-cultural dating occupies another 
                span of uncharted territories; it is often a topic of discussion cast aside in the face of more 
                pressing transitional questions that immigrant parents reserve until a later date, “when the time comes”. <br>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <br>Imagine the dawning that overcame me during my formative years, when many of my American 
                friends began to explore their amorous inklings with the individuals of their choosing. Ridden 
                with hormones and a newly-developed image of what constituted middle and high-school dating - 
                attending high school football games together, spending Thanksgiving at each other’s houses, 
                taking 2011 Instagram pictures with each other’s heads nestled against the other and adding an 
                overly-toasted filter - I, for the first time, began to understand that my dating life would 
                not be quite as simple as that. I can speak only from my experience with Southeastern Asian-born 
                parents, but dating was considered to be a more formal undertaking than what was practiced by 
                the middle-to-upper-class white citizens of my Southern city.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>This is, by no means, a critique of non-Western culture. Now that I’m older and (hopefully) wiser, 
                I enjoy talking about these variances with fellow first and second-generation friends at my university. 
                When I was younger, dating was a topic that in its raw entirety I skidded around. Of course, I had 
                crushes here and there, but I was always relieved when they were unrequited. I didn’t want to face 
                the complexities and uncomfortable questions of intercultural dating. Avoiding embarrassment was 
                high on my list of priorities, especially as one of the only second-gen, brown girls at my schools.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I don’t want any non-brown readers to confuse my avoidance of dating with a telling of my parents’ strictness. 
                First, chances are, any non-white parents will be a different kind of strict. (Telling my mom to “shut-up”, 
                à la the young white teens who often made appearances on Dr. Phil, would have brought to me an untimely fate.) 
                I didn’t have a tracking device on my phone, and my mom didn’t screen all my friends for ‘good breeding’. 
                Secondly, yes, my parents did encourage me to put off dating for later years, but the fact of the matter is: 
                cross-cultural dating is hard. Especially when I felt that in my case, my parents came from a different world.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Imagine the freedom I felt when I began university and met other brown women and femmes who, like me, 
                knew that their love lives came with a lot of  “cultural baggage,” if you will. I loved discussing our shared 
                experiences, and was overjoyed to know that I wasn’t the alien brown girl. In an effort to construct a fuller 
                narrative of intercultural dating, I’ve compiled some thoughts from first and sec-gen women and femmes*. 
                Some topics mentioned are culturally expansive and can’t possibly be elaborated in this short article. 
                I only hope to highlight these differences and hopefully, provide a greater understanding of a topic not 
                widely acknowledged between families.<br>

                <br><b>Are there ever parts of your personality, upbringing, etc that you feel your partner/past partners 
                can’t understand due to a racial or ethnic difference in identities?</b><br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Emily:</b> I feel like I have a difficult time explaining to my partner the connection and complicated 
                relationship that I have with my family, especially my parents. There’s kind of an unbreakable bond there - 
                despite their strictness and how they are often times unreasonable. There’s a lot of love there, but there’s 
                a lot that they’ve sacrificed so that me and my siblings can live comfortably. The love runs so deep, 
                and it’s hard love sometimes.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Ayanna:</b> I don’t think I’ve ever really been able to, or have really felt the energy to describe 
                so many parts of my upbringing to them. Stuff like being teased by older family members from a young age to 
                toughen you up in a world that doesn’t love black people, or being versed not to put my hands in my pockets 
                in stores is so hard to explain. And also the extent of manners and traditions that I was taught, I nod 
                and speak to older black people everywhere I go because it’s been customary to always do that and I don’t 
                know how to explain it to others.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Maya:</b> I’d say that my partner and I have a lot of things we don’t understand about one another 
                having had two different upbringings- him being a White male from a wealthy family and a privileged upbringing, 
                and myself being a first generation student to immigrants who initially struggled to keep us afloat. I wish 
                he could just “get it” sometimes.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Charlotte:</b> My partner had trouble understanding how open I am with my parents.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Sofia:</b> Yes. I guess it's more nuanced for me - but for the most part, my only long-term 
                relationship was with another person of color and he was patient and understanding with our 
                ethnic/racial differences. most of our conflicts in that realm were due to the differences 
                in our socioeconomic statuses. But previous to that relationship, I did date a lot of white men who 
                could not grasp my mixed identity or just didn't even really consider me Asian.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><b>Have you ever felt like you couldn’t relate to your partner due to racial/ethnic differences?</b><br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Maya:</b> Oh, definitely! I tend to share more stories/instances where I’ve encountered something I find 
                racially insensitive and feel uncomfortable with and it’s something that he never really has to encounter leaving 
                our conversation sort of one-sided. If I were dating a POC, I think there would be a more empathetic understanding 
                rather than a sympathetic one, I’m not sure if that makes sense… Similarly, I do share things with my partner 
                but I tend to talk to other Asian people who I can more closely identify with rather than turning to my partner. 
                I haven’t dated anyone who wasn’t a cis White male so I have yet to understand how I can relate to a partner 
                in this sense. I heard a joke from Ali Wong’s Netflix Special Baby Cobra, in which she joked about having an 
                Asian husband and them getting to be “racist” at home together; I hope that’s not true but I found her 
                commentary on being able to poke at White people together sort of funny. But in short, yes, I definitely 
                feel alienated in my experience sometimes with my partner but am glad that he never asks me to explain 
                things and do more emotional labor than I choose to.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Emily:</b> I think it’s the most difficult when I meet my partner’s family. I always feel uncomfortable 
                being the only POC in a completely white-dominated space. We haven’t gotten to that stage yet, but I have with 
                other white male partners and it’s always awkward and uncomfortable and I feel like I have to make myself as 
                white as possible in order to be liked and accepted. I’m also not religious, and I always feel awkward when the 
                inevitable question of “Do you go to church?” comes up from my partners’ family.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Charlotte:</b> I had trouble understanding the degree to which he hid things from his mom.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Remi:</b> In short, yes. My first *serious* relationship was with a Bolivian guy, while I was in Bolivia, 
                and apart from our language barrier (he spoke decent English and I was learning Spanish, but a lot was still lost 
                in translation), there were times when he couldn’t make me understand his culture and I couldn’t make him understand 
                mine. For example, I am a very political, left-leaning person, and my staunchly feminist views were more or 
                less completely foreign and often, unfathomable to Alex, who had been raised in a conservative, machista culture 
                that he had only ever benefited from. Although Alex would have been “otherized” in the United States because of 
                the color of his skin and his native tongue, most of our differences stemmed not from ethnic or racial differences,
                but from distinctly cultural ones.<br>

                <br><b>Kofi:</b> I hate when it becomes a fetish. Especially those white women who can “only date black men” 
                but have nothing to say about police brutality, mass incarceration, Silent Sam, etc. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Emily:</b> I think that in my past partners, they tried to view me as this passive and submissive Asian 
                indie girl. I think Asian women are super fetishized in relationships, especially by white “indie” men because 
                of their perceived passivity. Asian women are also “edgy” and “not mainstream” so it appeals to the group of 
                shitty hipster men to try to do everything to further their own image and “indie”ness lol. I feel like naturally, 
                Asian women are viewed as the ideal “manic pixie dream girl” because they’re so “mysterious” and sexualized/passive 
                and they are also “foreign” but not too foreign that it’s intimidating or scary if you get what I mean.

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Sofia:</b> I've previously dated white men with Asian fetishes and it fucking sucked. I had a really big 
                complex around it for a while - this one guy I was seeing was really into East Asian women and I didn't fall 
                squarely in to that category because I'm mixed. He would make comments about how my more East Asian looking 
                friends were hot and would try to have sex with them while we were seeing each other. It made me realize I had 
                internalized insecurities about not fitting in to either the South Asian or East Asian communities due to to the 
                way I look. It also made me really ashamed of my body and how I wasn't as "classically" beautiful as people who 
                were either 100% Indian, Chinese, or Filipino.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Remi:</b> I don’t know if my relationship counted as a caricature or stereotype, but there definitely is a 
                fetishization of lighter skin in Latin America, particularly (and ironically) in predominantly indigenous countries 
                like Bolivia, and since I’m white, pale, and a redhead, some people-- and sometimes even I-- questioned whether Alex 
                liked me for me, or if he was just into white chicks.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Maya:</b> I haven’t been in many relationships but my past boyfriend did always seem to fetishize Asian women 
                and seemed elated to finally date an Asian girl. My race is a huge part of my identity and influences how I interact 
                with the world but sometimes it felt like my race was all I was to him? At least that’s what I conjured up in my mind 
                whenever I thought I was just someone he was checking off his list.<br>

                <br><b>Kofi:</b> Growing up I couldn’t even date! I couldn’t talk about boys because I was only supposed to focus on school. 
                I watched a lot of other people around me have public boyfriends and invite their boyfriends over for dinner and go on dates 
                and I never could. My parents don’t know about any past partners! I honestly haven’t had many boyfriends.<br>

                <br><b>Remi:</b> My family knew about Alex and met him when they visited me in Bolivia, and they adored him. Since the 
                entirety of our relationship took place in another country, our racial/ethnic difference was hardly discussed amongst 
                my immediate family. Even my grandmother was excited about him, even though she made off-handed comments about how 
                “beautiful” our mixed race babies would be, and told me I couldn’t marry him because his surname was too difficult to 
                pronounce.<br>

                couple months of dating, but eventually met him after almost a year of dating. Race/ethnicity was brought up from the get go and 
                still something I don’t think they are past. Even though they like him, they also intended to see me date/marry within my race, 
                and I don’t think they have come to terms with that potentially not happening.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Emily:</b> I feel like in East Asian Chinese culture, there’s this weird idolization of white men, or the Western man. 
                People in China glorify white people to the extent that if you’re white and walking on the streets, common Chinese people will 
                oftentimes ask you to take pictures with them because they think you’re so beautiful. I know that my parents also idolize 
                the white man, but I know that deep down, they would prefer me to marry someone inside my own race. I think they want people 
                to know that their daughter can score the “prize” of the unattainable and idolized white male, but don’t actually want me to be with 
                one. I kind of understand it too - I’m in a relationship with a white male now who is absolutely wonderful and understanding and 
                open-minded, but it’s still exhausting to have to explain these racial and familial differences. I think that if I was dating 
                someone of my own race, they would automatically just get it and there wouldn’t have to be a lot of explaining to do. But I have to
                remind myself that easier doesn’t always mean better or happier! I’ve dated a Chinese boy before, and honestly it sucked.  It’s not 
                always about who “gets it” immediately, but who’s willing to compromise and learn and be together with you to make sure the both of 
                you are happy in your relationship and the way you interact with each other.<br>

                <br><b>Sofia:</b> Yes. My family, since I was a kid, has told me not to date any black folks. My mom has softened on that stance now due 
                to mine and my brothers consistent pushback on that topic. As children, we were encouraged to date only other Asians or white folks.<br>

                <br><b>Remi:</b> In eighth grade, I got my first boyfriend, and my grandmother’s first question about him was if he was white. While 
                neither my parents nor my brother ever encouraged or even lightly suggested I need to date within our race, my grandparents, 
                despite their love of Barack Obama, still believe in the myth that a white woman’s innocence must be protected from men of color, 
                especially black men. If I had introduced Alex to my grandparents, they may have been trepidatious and certainly very cringe-y, 
                but they wouldn’t stop speaking to me or be angry about me for dating outside of my race.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Remi:</b> Alex was, by Bolivian standards, a pretty liberal guy, but I did have some reservations about cultural differences and familial 
                expectations that never disappeared throughout the time that we were dating. Feminist and/or leftist views about abortion or racial equality were 
                very much frowned upon in eastern Bolivian culture, and Alex was no exception. Among his immediate family, or around his mother and siblings at least, 
                I felt like I could be myself, but his grandparents would ask us about marriage and I had to lie to them and tell them I was Catholic 
                so they wouldn’t reject me.<br>

                <br><b>Sofia:</b> I didn't when I was younger, but I know better now. As it stands, I don't think I would pursue a long-term 
                relationship with a white man, unless they are actually amazing. There are WAY too many things I have to break down about race, 
                class, socioeconomic status, etc. that I honestly find pretty exhausting. I don't want a partner where I have to explain myself 
                and my culture for easy absorption by him and his white family.  I don't have the patience for it anymore. I need a partner who 
                can relate and understand my experience of growing up not white in America.<br>

                <br><b>Maya:</b> Yes, absolutely. Both times that I’ve been in a relationship with a white male, 
                I was always scared that their families wouldn’t accept me because I was Asian. My current boyfriend reassured me 
                that his parents don’t think that way but I still had a feeling they would prefer him to date a white person.<br>

            <p class="quote">
                <br><b>Emily:</b> Yes, I totally feel like I have reservations about dating people outside of my race, especially if they’re 
                white/cis/male. I feel like my guard is just automatically up. It automatically becomes a “alright, you have to prove yourself 
                that you don’t suck like most white/cis/hetero males.” Honestly, that’s not a bad thing, to have your guard up all the time. 
                I feel like I put too much trust in boys who are of the same race as me and don’t realize that they can also suck and be bad people.<br>
