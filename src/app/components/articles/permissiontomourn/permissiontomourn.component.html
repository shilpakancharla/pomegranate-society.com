                <br>Did you know you can learn silence as a child and grow up thinking you were shy? As an adult, 
                you start to question whether you were born with that personality trait, or if, actually, someone made you 
                believe you deserved to be invisible.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>On the morning of September 11th, 2001, we were running late to school. My dad let me ride in the front seat 
                of the car as we listened to the radio. I remember him telling me something bad had happened in New York City. A 
                bad person had caused the deaths of thousands. From all the way in California, it seemed so far away, but outside 
                my classroom, I hugged my friend who had family in New York, trying to offer sympathy about a situation I had almost 
                no understanding of. Why would someone want to hurt so many people? We opened the door to the classroom and...that’s it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I don’t remember what happened that day in class. I don’t even have real memories of first grade. All I have are 
                fleeting snapshots of the cafeteria and the playground. There are no distinct recollections of experiences or conversations. 
                It’s just disconnected imagery. Even the memory I have of that morning is fuzzy. And yes, it was a long time ago, but even 
                my memories from preschool are more abundant and vivid than the few recollections I associate with first grade.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>Growing up, I was always inquisitive. My mom would tell me stories about how she would take me places and I’d 
                constantly be asking, <i>“What’s that?”</i> about everything, including my surroundings, people, and objects. But for some 
                reason, I didn’t really question my parents’ decision to change my school after first grade. All these years, 
                I guess I attributed it to finding a better school, whatever that meant to six-year-old me.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>A couple of years ago, my mom explained that after 9/11, my teacher, a white woman, became very hostile towards 
                me and my family. She said that she would always ask about my parents about their religious affiliation in a suspicious, 
                spiteful way, as if she was waiting for them to admit to something. She would question how people who came from a country 
                like Iran could “safely” parent an American child. This was if she even engaged with them at all. Hearing this didn’t 
                surprise me, but what did was my mom’s countless stories about how I would come home crying every day, telling her 
                that my teacher would ignore me on purpose, always assert that I was wrong even though I knew I had the right answer, 
                and blame me for things I didn’t do.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I was shocked. Not that this didn’t make sense for my journey, because it definitely did. Why an incredibly 
                curious, outspoken child went from asking questions to hiding behind silence suddenly clicked. But even listening 
                to my mom tell these stories, I couldn’t remember a single one of them. It felt like the deeper I tried to go, the farther 
                away I got from accessing the memories. That level of trauma for someone so young was so intense that I had quite 
                literally erased it. That teacher had created a serving plate of what she believed were the maligned, corrupt parts 
                of my identity and I had swallowed it all before I even had the capacity to understand.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>When a powerful figure violates the trust of a child, the mind can employ 
                <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1?needAccess=true">traumatic amnesia</a> 
                to help a child maintain attachment to that figure by remaining unaware of the trauma. Traumatic amnesia, which is conceptualized within betrayal 
                trauma theory, isn’t so much a coping mechanism as it is a survival method. It can happen without a conscious decision to 
                repress the memories, and the “degree to which the most fundamental human ethics are violated can influence the nature, 
                form, and processes of trauma and responses to trauma.” So even if a trauma is significant in someone’s life, they can 
                still experience an information blockage that essentially obstructs the memory from being integrated into a narrative of 
                consciousness. My teacher’s betrayal of my trust created conflict between my external reality and my social dependence on 
                authority figures, or more personally, people I was taught I could trust.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>For those who experience traumatic amnesia, <a href="http://www.trauma-pages.com/a/vanderk2.php">“recall is triggered 
                by exposure to sensory or affective stimuli that match sensory or affective elements associated with the trauma.”</a> So even 
                though I’ve heard about these memories from my mom, I still can’t remember any of them due to the lack of sensory or affective triggers. As a child, I had even fewer 
                mental capacities to construct a coherent narrative out of traumatic events. In reality, I have probably encountered some 
                of the triggers in the past and failed to recall them even then due to the trauma occurring at such an integral stage of 
                development. Who knows, maybe I’ve even encountered them in the past and failed to recall them even then.

            <p>
                <br>People who have any ties to the Middle Eastern, South Asian, or Muslim communities, or even those who visually “pass” 
                as part of any of those know that 
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/us/politics/hate-crimes-american-muslims-rise.html">9/11 was a defining moment for how we are viewed in American society</a>. While I’m sure 
                people outside those communities can calculate the rise in difficulty of being Brown, Muslim, or both, I had trouble 
                articulating the sheer magnitude of trauma people’s perceptions have inflicted on our lives since 2001.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>As kids were learning the difference between good and bad, my family and I became the perfect example of a villain. 
                Before my classmates could even do fractions, they knew that people who looked like me, people who wore headscarves, 
                and people with non-Western sounding names did not belong in their American world. Their parents’ grief was quickly 
                assigned to us, and it felt as if we weren’t allowed to mourn the tragedy with the rest of the country. My childhood 
                and adolescence were quickly converted from the innocence of learning to the responsibility of explanation and defending 
                myself.<br>

            <p>
                <br>Growing up, I gained more and more understanding of what 9/11 meant, for the country and for my people. 
                I grew up hyphenating my identity to Iranian-American any time someone would ask me where I was from. This was at the 
                pressing request of my mom, who emphasized that I deserved to identify myself as American and would need to do so in order 
                to survive. I learned to conceal my heritage until I absolutely had to disclose it, and it wasn’t easy considering the “otherness” of 
                my name or appearance. When I’m in public, people don’t automatically assume I am American. The question of where I am 
                from and if I was born here have become part of the majority of my introductions with people, simply because my ambiguity 
                is alarming to them and they are more concerned with “placing” me than knowing me.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I remember all those things, mostly because they are still happening now. It isn’t a secret that for Brown people 
                and Muslims of any background, living in a post-9/11 world means random searches at the airport, harassment both online 
                and in person, and being called a terrorist based on your heritage. It means that when you answer the question “where 
                are you from?” it comes out like an apology.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>The reality of repressing the trauma of first grade isn’t that I get to live without the harmful memories. 
                It’s riddled with the confusion of reconciling that I do not have to apologize for something I had no part in. It’s 
                feeling guilty about finding solidarity among other affected people in the wake of something so horrible. It’s the 
                feeling I had when I visited the World Trade Center memorial with my family two years ago. Lingering guilt, resentment, 
                and an overwhelming sense of intrusion. I had been tricked into thinking I was responsible for people’s pain, and that 
                I had to atone for it by suffering.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>I am unlearning the biases I was fed about myself. I am practicing telling myself that it isn’t the responsibility 
                of people of color to remove unwarranted blame from our identities. While I’m not eager to access the trauma-ridden 
                memories I compartmentalized, I do want to forgive myself for believing the injustices committed against myself, my 
                family, and my community were warranted. Blaming the actions of a few on entire groups not only creates divisions, 
                but also promotes solidarity among the ignorant and bigoted. If we want to dismantle that, we cannot give space to 
                those prejudices and allow them to fester, especially not on children. I am not the only one who had to switch schools, 
                grow up afraid of seeming too visible or concealing my family origin. Our world is no more forgiving than it was when 
                I was in first grade.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>It breaks my heart that a little girl excited about learning, making her way in the world, and creating friendships 
                was swept away from those innocent ambitions by people’s ignorance. In a way, I look back on that period of my life as 
                if I’m envisioning a different person, disconnected and far away. But in the moments I feel the weight of my identity now, 
                especially when I’m angry with myself, I try to remember that little girl. She was confused, afraid, and desperately 
                latching on to the bursts of joy that every child should have while simultaneously trying to defend an entire culture. 
                Imagining the opportunity to comfort and reassure little Negar, I tell her:<br>
            </p>
